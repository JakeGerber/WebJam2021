This is a high-lower game created with React.js that utilized YouTubeâ€™s API to allow users to pick between two randomly selected videos to see which one had the higher view count.

These are the files used to create the project. If you would like to try it out, make sure to generate a Google API key and insert it into the YT_Key string.
